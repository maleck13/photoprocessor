# gosexy/exif

A primitive Go binding for [libexif][1].

## How to install

```
go get github.com/gosexy/exif
```

## Usage

Install the package with `go get` and use `import` to include it in your project.

```
import "github.com/gosexy/exif"
```

This is an example on how to read EXIF data from a file:

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "github.com/gosexy/exif"

func main() {
    
    // open an exif reader and read the file from system
    reader := exif.New()
    err := reader.Open("_examples/resources/test.jpg")
    
    // check to make sure we can read the exif data
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error: %s", err.Error())
    }

    // print out key,val pair for each tag
    for key, val := range reader.Tags {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %s\n", key, val)
    }
}
```

If you just have the image available as an io.Reader, you can parse the
EXIF header like this:

```
reader := exif.New()

_, err = io.Copy(reader, data)

// exif.FoundExifInData is a signal that the EXIF parser has all it needs,
// it doesn't need to be given the whole image.
if err != nil && err != exif.FoundExifInData {
  t.Fatalf("Error loading bytes: %s", err.Error())
}

err := reader.Parse()

if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("Error parsing EXIF: %s", err.Error())
}

for key, val := range reader.Tags {
  fmt.Printf("%s: %s\n", key, val)
}
```

There is currently no support for writing EXIF data to images, however if
someone would care to make the effort it would be great.
